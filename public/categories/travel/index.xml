      <description>Year end and still I was waiting for the last destination to touch, and then I thought of one of the neighbouring country of India - Sri Lanka, sorrounded by Indian Ocean. Also, No.1 country to travel in 2019 as per some stats. Exactly that was my thought, what different does this has to get this tag and to answer that I go ahead and started my trip to Sri Lanka.</description>

      <description>I visited Andaman on May 2019 for 6 days with my family. It was indeed an amazing experience. As always, I preferred to explore places with my own research and certainly with the help of people&#39;s review.
Following is my itinerary (Hope this will help you guys) -
I took the flight from Delhi with a 30 minute layover in Kolkata. 90% Flights travels only in day time to Andaman (so, planned your itinerary accordingly).</description>
