      <description>I visited Andaman on May 2019 for 6 days with my family. It was indeed an amazing experience. As always, I preferred to explore places with my own research and certainly with the help of people&amp;rsquo;s review.
Following is my itinerary (Hope this will help you guys) -
I took the flight from Delhi with a 30 minute layover in Kolkata. 90% Flights travels only in day time to Andaman (so, planned your itinerary accordingly).</description>
